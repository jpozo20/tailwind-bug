    <h1>Waiting for service worker</h1>

    <p>
      If you see this message, it means the service worker has not loaded fully.
    </p>

    <p>
      During development, the service worker reroutes HTML requests to the dev
      server, so this file isn't used unless the extension service worker opens
      a page immediately after a full extension reload, and before the service
      worker takes control of fetch (e.g., in the onInstalled event). In that
      case, this page will continuously reload until the service worker is
      ready, always less than 100 ms.

    <p>This page is never added in production.</p>
